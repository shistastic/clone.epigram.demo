# Screen replication from epigram.tech

Replicating/Cloning the layout and design of some of the mobile application screens found at epigram.tech just to test my basic layouting speed and warming up to flutter after 2 weeks of non-flutter development.

# First Screen to be replicated
## Development time: 2 hours.
## Difficulty: Easy
## Color Accuracy: Low

In this case all the data is hardcoded but previously prepared the store to add data using redux's state management.
# TO DO: Most of the elements should be widgetized!
